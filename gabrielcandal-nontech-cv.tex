{Leading the planning and execution of a software-as-a-service platform for helping companies breaking free from stock and transition to made-to-order. Joined the company in a transformation phase, having to build processes and teams from scratch while still responding to business demands, resulting in:
\begin{itemize}
  \item The conception of an interconnected software development process between the design, engineering and quality assurance teams, resulting in the delivery to external stakeholders (non-tech teams, sales, clients)
  \item Ongoing quality assurance relying on an \href{https://github.com/ripe-tech/ripe-rainbow/}{in-house testing framework}
  \item A software team comprised of recent graduates, experienced developers, interns and freelancers capable of continuously deliver new products that leverage a common framework
  \item Teams that were able to work fully remote
\end{itemize}}

Among other things, I have:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Coordinated a 3-person team that successfully built a prototype for a Fortune 500 company's RFP for replacing their entire fraud solution
  \item Coordinated a 5-person team to deliver 2 major features
  \item Helped filtering candidates, onboard and mentor new colleagues (from software engineers to product owners and engineering managers)
\end{itemize}}
