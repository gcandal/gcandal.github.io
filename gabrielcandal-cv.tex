\subsection{Working}
\cventry{Dec 2016-*}{Software Engineer}{\href{http://www.feedzai.com}{Feedzai}}{}{}
{Working on providing near real-time machine learning through a multi-threaded, distributed and fault-tolerant system.
\newline \textbf{Technologies}: Java 8 (+ Guava, Guice, JUnit, JMockit, ...), Scala, Cassandra, Zookeeper, RabbitMQ, Spark.}
\cventry{2015-2016}{Software Engineer}{\href{http://www.platforme.com}{PLATFORME International}}{}{}
{Joined as the 3rd developer a team that built a best of breed web 3D customiser,
integrating it with \href{https://www.farfetch.com/}{farfetch.com}, as well as
its own e-commerce engine. Individually, I have:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Contributed to all areas of our products, from the core
  customiser to the website's front and back-ends (including the e-commerce engine)
  \item Built an analytics dashboard
  \item Improved a platform for running and monitoring parallel image transformation tasks
  (with a 2-8x speedup when compared to its predecessor)
\end{itemize}
Besides doing software development, I have also gathered requirements from internal and external
stakeholders and helped schedule and coordinate tasks within the technical team. Used MongoDB, Python, HTML/CSS and Javascript (jQuery).

\cventry{2014-2015}{Co-Founder \& Lead Developer}{Trigonum}{}{}
{Responsible for the software development in a company focused on products for
health professionals. Used HTML/CSS, PHP, jQuery and PostgreSQL.}
\cventry{\small Jul-Aug \normalsize 2013}{Software Developer Intern}{\href{http://www.criticalmanufacturing.com/pt/homepage}{
Critical Manufacturing}}{}{}{Together with a colleague developed an
tool to assist developers in testing. Compared to the one previously used
it ran 5x faster, besides providing information
as structured XML and producing 3x smaller files. Used C++ and Solaris.}
