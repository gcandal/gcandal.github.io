\subsection{Working}
\cventry{Apr 2019-*}{Head of Software}{\href{http://www.platforme.com}{Platforme}}{}{}
{Joined the company in a transformation phase, having to build processes and teams from scratch while still responding to business demands, resulting in:
\begin{itemize}
  \item The conception of an interconnected software development process between the design, engineering and quality assurance teams, resulting in the delivery to external stakeholders (non-tech teams, sales, clients)
  \item DevOps practices, with continuous deployment and testing of all products based on Jenkins and GitHub Actions
  \item Ongoing quality assurance relying on an \href{https://github.com/ripe-tech/ripe-rainbow/}{in-house testing framework}
  \item A software team comprised of recent graduates, experienced developers, interns and freelancers capable of continuously deliver new products that leverage a common framework (in-house SDKs, APIs and component libraries)
  \item Teams that were able to work fully remote
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Technologies}: Javascript, Python, Vue.js, React, React Native, Selenium}
\cventry{Dec 2016-*}{Software Engineer}{\href{http://www.feedzai.com}{Feedzai}}{}{}
{Working on providing machine learning through a distributed system under strict performance requirements for some of the world's largest banks, payment processors and merchants.
Among other things, I have:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Built an highly available PCI DSS-compliant key management system
  \item Worked in a team that consistently delivered new features for the core fraud detection engine
  \item Participated on the on-call rotation for high severity issues
  \item Coordinated a 3-person team that successfully built a prototype for a Fortune 500 company's RFP for replacing their entire fraud solution
  \item Coordinated a 5-person team to deliver 2 major features: changing the system's detection rules in runtime with no downtime, as well as a simulator of the real-time engine optimized for batch data
  \item Helped filtering candidates, onboard and mentor new colleagues (from software engineers to product owners and engineering managers)
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Technologies}: Java 8 (+ Guava, Guice, JUnit, JMockit, ...), Scala, Cassandra, Zookeeper, RabbitMQ, Spark, Flink.}
\cventry{2015-2016}{Software Engineer}{\href{http://www.platforme.com}{Platforme}}{}{}
{Joined as the 3rd developer a team that built a best of breed web 3D customiser,
integrating it with \href{https://www.farfetch.com/}{farfetch.com}, as well as
its own e-commerce engine.
\begin{itemize}
  \item Contributed to all areas of our products, from the core
  customiser to the website's front and back-ends (including the e-commerce engine)
  \item Built an analytics dashboard
  \item Improved a platform for running and monitoring parallel image transformation tasks
  (with a 2-8x speedup when compared to its predecessor)
\end{itemize}
Besides doing software development, I have also gathered requirements from internal and external
stakeholders and helped schedule and coordinate tasks within the technical team. \textbf{Technologies}: MongoDB, Python, HTML/CSS and Javascript (jQuery).

\cventry{\small Jul-Aug \normalsize 2013}{Software Developer Intern}{\href{http://www.criticalmanufacturing.com/pt/homepage}{
Critical Manufacturing}}{}{}{Together with a colleague developed an
tool to assist developers in testing. Compared to the one previously used
it ran 5x faster, besides providing information
as structured XML and producing 3x smaller files. Used C++ and Solaris.}
