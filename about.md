title: About me
---

I’m Gabriel, a Software Engineer from Porto, Portugal. Even if I’m mostly doing fullstack web development lately, I’m profoundly interested in reactive programming, distributed systems and big data.

My allegiance lies with functional programming and I’m an evangelist of strong static typing, but if you are part of a small but highly capable engineering-driven team whom I can learn from, maybe we can set our differences aside.

Oh, I also like MOOCs too much for my own sake, love football and practice karaté, so proceed with caution.
